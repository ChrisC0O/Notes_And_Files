# Guide to Setting Up Caddy Web Server on Fedora

Caddy is a powerful, open-source web server that automatically enables HTTPS, serves static files, acts as a reverse proxy, and more. It's ideal for creating directory index pages (like the one in your screenshot) with built-in browsing features. This guide walks you through installing Caddy on a Fedora server (tested on Fedora 42+, but should work on recent versions), configuring it for a basic directory listing, and enabling automatic HTTPS. We'll use the official installation method from caddyserver.com.

**Prerequisites:**
- A Fedora server with root or sudo access.
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP (optional for local testing, but required for public HTTPS).
- Firewall configured to allow ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). On Fedora, use `firewall-cmd`.
- Basic familiarity with the terminal.

## Step 1: Update Your System
Ensure your system is up to date to avoid package conflicts.

```
sudo dnf update -y
```

## Step 2: Install Prerequisites
Fedora uses `dnf` as the package manager. Install the DNF plugins for COPR (Cool Other Package Repo) support.

```
sudo dnf install dnf5-plugins -y
```

## Step 3: Enable the Official Caddy Repository
Caddy provides an official COPR repository for Fedora. Enable it with:

```
sudo dnf copr enable @caddy/caddy -y
```

This adds the repository maintained by the Caddy team.

## Step 4: Install Caddy
Install the Caddy package:

```
sudo dnf install caddy -y
```

This installs Caddy as a systemd service but doesn't start it automatically.

## Step 5: Configure Firewall (If Enabled)
Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Step 6: Start and Enable Caddy Service
Start the service and enable it to run on boot:

```
sudo systemctl start caddy
sudo systemctl enable caddy
```

Check the status:

```
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

If it's running, you'll see output indicating the service is active.

## Step 7: Configure Caddy for a Directory Index Page
Caddy uses a configuration file called `Caddyfile` (by default at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`). We'll set it up to serve a directory with browsing enabled, similar to your screenshot. This enables an elegant file browser for directories without an index.html.

1. Create a directory to serve (e.g., `/var/www/downloads`) and add some subdirectories/files for testing:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/downloads/{captions,clearvision,documents,scripts,tracker,uploads,wallpapers}
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/downloads  # For easier editing; adjust permissions as needed
   ```

   Add some placeholder files if desired (e.g., `touch /var/www/downloads/captions/test.txt`).

2. Edit the Caddyfile:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

   Replace the contents with a basic configuration. Assuming you have a domain like `example.com` (replace with yours). For local testing, use `localhost`.

   ```
   example.com {
       root * /var/www/downloads
       file_server browse
       encode gzip zstd  # Optional: Enable compression
   }
   ```

   - `root * /var/www/downloads`: Sets the root directory to serve.
   - `file_server browse`: Enables the directory listing browser with features like file sizes, dates, and icons.
   - If using localhost for testing: Replace `example.com` with `localhost` or your server's IP.
   - For automatic HTTPS: Caddy will handle TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt if the domain is public and DNS is pointed correctly.

3. Reload Caddy to apply changes (Caddy supports graceful reloads without downtime):

   ```
   sudo systemctl reload caddy
   ```

## Step 8: Test the Setup
- Visit `http://example.com` (or `http://your-server-ip`) in a browser. Caddy will redirect to HTTPS automatically if configured.
- You should see a directory listing similar to your screenshot, showing folders like `captions/`, `clearvision/`, etc., with names, sizes (empty folders show `-`), and dates.
- For local testing: `http://localhost` or `https://localhost` (Caddy auto-installs a local CA for HTTPS on localhost).

If HTTPS doesn't work:
- Ensure your domain's DNS A/AAAA records point to the server's IP.
- Check logs: `journalctl -u caddy` for errors (e.g., certificate issuance issues).
- Allow time for DNS propagation.

## Step 9: Advanced Tips
- **Automatic HTTPS for Custom Domains**: As described in the Caddy docs, it uses On-Demand TLS. No extra config needed for public domains.
- **Security**: Set proper permissions (`chmod -R 755 /var/www/downloads`) and consider adding authentication if exposing sensitive files.
- **Updates**: Update Caddy with `sudo dnf update caddy` and reload the service.
- **Custom Builds**: If you need plugins (e.g., for PHP with FrankenPHP), download custom builds from caddyserver.com/download.
- **Troubleshooting**: View full docs at caddyserver.com/docs. Common issues include firewall blocks or SELinux (disable temporarily with `setenforce 0` if needed, but harden later).

This setup replicates a simple index download page using Caddy's built-in features. If you need to integrate with the caddyserver.com demo (e.g., pointing a subdomain to their IP for testing automagic HTTPS), follow the "Experience it" section in the provided documentâ€”no local changes needed beyond DNS updates. For more complex configs like reverse proxies or PHP, expand the Caddyfile as shown in the examples. Let me know if you encounter issues!
